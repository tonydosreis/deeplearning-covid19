Fever with body temperatures ranging from 37.2oC to 40oC. Severe cough with phlegm at onset of illness. Experienced dizziness. respiratory failure, was given high flow noninvasive ventilation. Physical examination of cardiovascular, abdominal and neurologic examination was normal. Mild lymphopenia (less than 900 cells per cubic milli-meter) was observed, but white blood cell and blood platelet count was normal in a complete blood count (CBC) test. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, 41.4 mg/L of blood, reference range 0-6 mg/L) was observed and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase were slightly elevated in blood chemistry tests. The patient had mild hypoxemia with oxygen levels of 67mmHg by the Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test. On the first day of admission (day 6 after the onset of illness), chest radiographs were abnormal with air-space shadowing such a ground-glass opacities, focal consolidation and patchy consolidation in both lungs (Figure 1). Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed bilateral focal consolidation, lobar consolidation and patchy consolidation, especially in the lower lung. A chest radiograph revealed a bilateral diffuse patchy and fuzzy shadow on day 5 after admission (day 11 after the onset of illness). Preliminary aetiological investigation excluded the presence of influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae by commercial pathogen antigen detection kits and confirmed by PCR. Other common respiratory pathogens, including adenovirus, were also negative by qPCR (Figure S1). The condition of the patient did not improve after three days of treatment with combined antiviral and antibiotic therapy. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treatment with a high flow non-invasive ventilator was initiated. The patient was transferred to another hospital in Wuhan for further treatment 6 days after admission. ",,,"['Figure 1. Chest radiographs of patient 1. a. b. c. d.
